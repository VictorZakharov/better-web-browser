# Layout compatibility: measured standards slices

Updated 2026-09-13. Wikipedia is a regression example, not a source of special-case
selectors or layout rules. These changes do **not** establish pixel-perfect Wikipedia
rendering or complete implementation of CSS Grid, tables, buttons, or legacy collections.

## Implemented contracts

| Contract | Implementation and regression evidence |
| --- | --- |
| [CSS Overflow scroll containers](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-overflow-3/#scrollable) | Element-owned offsets, clipped descendants, classic scrollbar gutters, thumb/track input, cancelable wheel defaults and scroll chaining. Hidden overflow remains programmatically scrollable; clip overflow does not. Both axes can induce gutters, without changing the outer border box. |
| [CSSOM View element scrolling](https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#dom-element-scrolltop) | Synchronous clamped `scrollTop`/`scrollLeft`, `scroll`/`scrollTo`/`scrollBy`, client/scroll extents and coalesced non-bubbling scroll events. Offset geometry stays unscrolled; client rectangles and hit testing use visual offsets. |
| [Sticky positioning](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-position-3/#sticky-pos) | Block-path sticky boxes follow the nearest scrollport within their containing block. Native viewport scrolling updates retained paint offsets without relaying out the document; normal-flow and offset geometry remain unchanged. Tests cover direct and wrapped scroller children, hidden versus clip overflow, inset limits, repeated reversal, and renderer presentation without JavaScript. |
| [Adjoining block margins](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/box.html#collapsing-margins) | Preserve positive/negative extrema through empty blocks and nested parent/child boundaries, with formatting-context and border/padding exclusions. Comments do not generate boxes or interrupt empty-block margin collapse. |
| [HTML button layout](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#button-layout) | Block-path buttons retain their authored descendants, clipping, and form metadata; automatic inline size is fit-content, with a formatting context and border-box default. An absolutely positioned hidden label no longer becomes visible native button text. |
| [CSS Fonts family lists](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-4/#font-family-prop) | Preserve ordered families through cascade, inheritance, shorthand, resource discovery, and renderer font selection. Parse quoted names, commas, escapes, and generic-family identity with the existing cssparser dependency. A missing first family no longer discards the specified fallback fonts. |
| [Grid spanning contributions](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/#algo-spanning-items) | Resolve non-spanning intrinsic row contributions before spans; spans crossing flexible rows contribute to the flex fraction instead of inflating title rows. Lay out stretched items using the resolved area height, including percentage descendants and observer/paint bounds. |
| [Table cell sizing](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/tables.html#auto-table-layout) | Percentage width preferences cannot starve another cell's intrinsic content, padding, and borders. Cell boxes use the shared row height, preserving backgrounds, clips, and bounds through normal block layout. |
| [Web IDL indexed properties](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#legacy-platform-object-getownproperty) | Unsupported HTMLCollection indices fall through to ordinary property lookup (`undefined` absent an inherited property), while `item()` still returns `null`. Property indices do not undergo `item()`'s unsigned-integer conversion. Tests cover sentinel iteration, prototype lookup, and live removal. |

Grid/table intrinsic block-size probes are isolated from published paint, hit-test, and
ResizeObserver state. Per-layout caches reuse nested intrinsic measurements; the final
layout publishes each node once. This is a correctness change, not a loading-speed claim.

The repository-owned `scroll-containers.html` fixture additionally checks direct and
wrapped sticky boxes after a 150px element scroll. Headless Chrome reports top positions
10px and 130px and a 185px content width inside 200px scrollers; layout regression tests
assert these values. Renderer-process tests exercise wheel cancellation, clipping-aware
clicks, scrollbar dragging and sticky viewport updates through the actual IPC path.
Scrollbar artwork is Breeze-owned, not a reproduction of the platform theme.

These slices are not a complete CSSOM View/Overflow/Position implementation. RTL scroll
origins, viewport horizontal scrolling, inline sticky fragmentation, independent-axis
clipping and fixed-position escape from nested clips still require further coverage.

## Controlled Chrome comparison

The repository-owned [layout-contracts fixture](../benchmarks/alpha/fixtures/layout-contracts.html)
contains no third-party page content or dependencies. Hidden release Breeze and headless
Chrome 152.0.7977.83 produced these identical CSS-pixel bounds on 2026-09-13:

| Box | x, y | Width × height (both browsers) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Heading | 20, 20 | 400 × 40 |
| Tabs | 20, 70 | 400 × 30 |
| Stretched article | 20, 110 | 400 × 510 |
| Spanning sidebar | 420, 20 | 200 × 600 |
| Block button | 20, 110 | 22 × 22 |
| Image cell | 20, 140 | 60 × 60 |
| Percentage text cell | 80, 140 | 340 × 60 |

Serve with `scripts/serve-alpha-fixtures.ps1` and use `scripts/run-hidden-benchmark.ps1`
for Breeze. The Chromium harness must retain `--headless`, `--mute-audio`, and
`CreateNoWindow`. Query `h1`, `nav`, `article`, `aside`, `button`, `.image`, and `.message`
with the harnesses' diagnostic-selector options. Captures and JSON reports stay under
ignored `target/wiki-regression/`, not in commits. The fixture's collection sentinel loop
also completes without a script error in both browsers.

## Live-page evidence and remaining gaps

On the reported Wikipedia article, the sidebar text overlap and notice/icon overlap are
removed, the serif heading uses its fallback font, and the artificial title-to-tabs gap
is removed. The previous `nodeType` exception also disappears. Missing sidebar arrows,
unchecked appearance controls, vertical spacing, and a heading rule painting across the
floating infobox remain visible. Console diagnostics now expose missing PerformanceObserver
support; this is not proof that it explains every remaining initialization difference.

Match **media viewport width**, not content width, when comparing responsive pages.
Breeze's 1694 × 960 outer window on this 125%-DPI machine has a 1680px media viewport and
1663.2px content width after its scrollbar. Chrome's viewport option includes its scrollbar.
Setting Chrome to 1663px incorrectly selected the opposite side of Wikipedia's 1680px
breakpoint. At 1680px both use a 260px left sidebar and 948px article column; their native
scrollbar widths still differ. Live banners/content can also vary between requests.

Further slices must cover margin collapsing and float paint order, broader grid track
constraints and self-alignment, shared multi-row table columns/spans and vertical alignment,
and the remaining page-initialization APIs. Inline/native control styling remains approximate.
Do not replace these gaps with site-specific CSS or claim full conformance from this fixture.
